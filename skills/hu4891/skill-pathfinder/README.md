# 🌐 Skill-Pathfinder

**A Meta-Skill Engine for AI Agents: Intelligent Routing, Global Discovery, and Visible Security Guard.**

---

## 🎯 What is Skill-Pathfinder?

When your AI Agent (like OpenClaw) encounters a missing capability or a complex long-chain task, **Skill-Pathfinder** takes over as the central orchestrator. To prevent LLM hallucinations, it strictly enforces the **Skill First** principle:
It breaks down complex intents, diagnoses local component gaps, automatically retrieves missing extension packages from global open-source communities (ClawHub, MCP Market, etc.), and runs a strict backend **visible security code pre-check and risk warning** before presenting them to you!

### 📡 Runtime & Permissions (Security Declaration)
To orchestrate tools dynamically and perform global searches, this skill explicitly declares the following requirements:
- **Runtime Required**: `Node.js` (`npm`/`npx`) and `Python 3` must be installed.
- **Filesystem Access**: Read access to `~/.agents/skills` to evaluate the current baseline.
- **Network Access**: Internet access to hub APIs (ClawHub, MCP, etc.) for skill discovery.
- *Note on Security*: Before downloading and recommending any external code, this skill enforces a strict local security scan using `npx agentguard scan` via a secured python wrapper.

## ✨ Key Features

1. **🧭 Intelligent Routing**
   It parses ambiguous language into a structured pipeline (e.g., `[Search Web] -> [Analyze Data] -> [Send Email]`) instead of doing everything in a single fragile prompt.

2. **🔍 Active Diagnostics**
   Automatically scans your `.agents/skills` directory and recommends essential starting kits (Web Browsing, File Operating, Calendar) if you are a new user.

3. **🌍 Global Discovery**
   Directly connects to major hubs (ClawHub, MCP Market, Smithery, Glama) to fetch whatever capability you lack.

4. **🛡️ Visible Security Guard**
   Integrates seamlessly with **AgentGuard**. Before recommending any external code, it runs a deep static scan (`security_check.py`). If it detects malicious intents like stealing keys, it drops the skill and **immediately reports the blockade to you**, so you know exactly why it was rejected.

5. **💬 Language Mirroring**
   No hardcoded UX texts. The status updates and safety prompts will automatically mirror the exact language you used in your initial prompt.

## 🚀 Installation

1. **Download the Package:** Download the `Skill-Pathfinder.skill` archive from the Releases page.
2. **Mount to your Agent:** Copy the folder directly into your global agent directory (e.g., `C:\Users\YourName\.agents\skills\Skill-Pathfinder`).
3. **Restart your AI Client:** (e.g., OpenClaw). The router will automatically hijack unhandled complex tasks!

## 🛠️ For Developers / Prompts Modification
If you wish to modify its behavior, you can directly edit:
- `SKILL.md`: The main entry and triggering boundary (what NOT to intercept).
- `references/routing.md`: Execution rules.
- `references/discovery.md`: External repo search priorities and AgentGuard strict hooks.
