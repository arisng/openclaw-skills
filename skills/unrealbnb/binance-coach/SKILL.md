# BinanceCoach

AI-powered crypto trading behavior coach. Connects to the user's Binance account (read-only) and provides portfolio analysis, behavioral coaching, and smart DCA recommendations via Claude.

## Setup (run this first)

```bash
scripts/setup.sh
```

`setup.sh` fully automates first-time setup:
1. Clones `https://github.com/UnrealBNB/BinanceCoachAI.git` into `~/workspace/binance-coach/`
2. Installs all Python dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
3. Interactively prompts for: Binance API keys, Anthropic API key, Telegram bot token (optional), language, risk profile, monthly DCA budget
4. Writes all answers to `.env` automatically
5. Verifies Binance + Anthropic connectivity

**When to run setup:**
- First time the skill is used on a new machine
- When a user says "set up BinanceCoach", "install the bot", "configure my keys"
- When `bc.sh <command>` returns "project not found" or API errors

**After setup**, all commands work immediately. No manual file editing needed.

## Running Commands

All commands run via the wrapper:

```bash
scripts/bc.sh <command> [args]
```

Or directly:

```bash
cd "$(scripts/bc.sh --path)" && python3 main.py
```

## Key Commands
